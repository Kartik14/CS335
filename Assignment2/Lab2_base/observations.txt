Task 2.5

Hyperparameters for task 2.1:
--------------------------------

learning Rate : 0.1

Number of Hidden Layers : 1 Fully Connected Layer

Number of Nodes in each Hidden layer : 6 
(Note: For certain seeds, I am able to achieve more than 90% with just 3 neurons in the training, but since the
architecture does not work for all seeds, I am using 6 nodes in the hidden layer.)

Batch Size : 10

Number of epochs : 25 

Training accuracies : 98.2

Corresponding Seed : 1

Hyperparameters for task 2.2:
--------------------------------

learning Rate : 0.1

Number of Hidden Layers : 1 Fully Connected Layer

Number of Nodes in each Hidden layer : 2

Batch Size : 10

Number of epochs : 20

Training accuracies : 97.1

Corresponding Seed : 1

Hyperparameters for task 2.3:
--------------------------------

learning Rate : 0.1

Number of Hidden Layers : 1 Fully Connected Layer

Number of Nodes in each Hidden layer : 25
(Note: For this dataset too, I was able to achieve 90%+ with just 8 neurons in the hidden layer for many seeds but
I am using 25 neurons as It gives me higher accuracies for all seeds)

Batch Size : 20

Number of epochs : 10

Training accuracies : 94.26

Corresponding Seed : 1

Hyperparameters for task 2.4:
--------------------------------

learning Rate : 0.1

Number of Hidden Layers : 3 Hidden Layers (A Convolutional Layer, followed by an an Average Pooling Layer,
followed by a Flattening Layer which is followed by a Fully Connected Layer)

Number of Nodes in each Hidden layer : 
1st Hidden Layer (Convolutional Layer) = 3*32*32
2nd Hidden Layer (Average Pooling Layer) = 8*9*9
3rd Hidden Layer (Fully Connected Layer) = 72

Batch Size : 8

Number of epochs : 12

Training accuracies : 38.9%

Corresponding Seed : 14
